// add this to my express boilerplate tomorrow. the one i just downloaded isn't as
// good as mine, but has a nicer authorization for JWT, however not as loosely coupled
// as I want it..Refactor the roles to not be as coupled with the equivalent of my auth.
// login functionality..and rename it to login, not JWT..
